### Workflows Help Workflow ###

Currently, there is just one command: __help__.

The workflow crawls through your installed workflows and pulls out the information about keywords and hotkeys among others and compiles a temporary help file that it shows view a quicklook debug utility.

Has Alleyoop support.

The file can take a few seconds to generate, and it is generated every time. This will change in a later version.

##### Dependencies and Testing: #####
Built on Mountain Lion (10.8.3)
_Should be compatible for all systems as the only dependencies are included in the workflow._

##### Roadmap: #####
* Cache the generated file and update it only when the workflow folder changes.
* Make the display of the file nicer.
* Add in more images to the file.
* Display individual workflow helps (show the data for that workflow as well as the readme.md file).
* Try to figure out a way to describe arguments taken for different commands / hotkeys.
* Make it understand file actions better.
* Clean up the file/folder structure.
* Some other ideas are written into the source code
* Maybe some more... any ideas?
